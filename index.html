				<h1> Hey! I'm Ainhoa, How's it going?</h1>

				I consider myself a proactive person, and I like to combine a good academic profile with other challegens outside the classroom. During the year, I have worked as a language tutor for kids, which has taught me how to balance my time well. Moreover, I like to spend time participating in volunteer programs, where I have learnt how to approach people from different backgrounds. For instance, I have collaborated at the Legal Clinic of my home town university, and I have also travelled to Morocco in the summer, to work as a volunteer teacher for underprivileged children. Finally, after spending a year abroad at a boarding school, and many summers in France and the United Kingdom, I have become quite capable of adapting to new environments, and I am eager to keep learning and improving as I grow!
